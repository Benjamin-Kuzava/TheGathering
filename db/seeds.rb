  title: 'Deck Guide: Legacy GW Reclaimer',
  content:
    '<p>With the Legacy metagame starting to shape up, we’re still seeing a lot of exciting decks find success that were struggling pre-ban. GW Reclaimer is one of those decks, and Magic Online player wara used the deck to take down a Challenge this past week. This is a really cool deck that started to show up a bit last year, but never really took off mostly as a result of a hostile metagame. Let’s take a look at the list and see what the deck is capable of.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>The Game Plan</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In many ways, this deck is a hybrid between Maverick and various Dark Depths decks. The primary plan is to create a Marit Lage with some level of consistency using cards like Elvish Reclaimer and Knight of the Reliquary. Cards like Mox Diamond speed up the strategy and Green Sun’s Zenith greatly increases the consistency of the deck.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Playing a variety of different creatures and lands gives this deck a toolbox feel, which means you’ll often be able to find the right card for the job. If you’re unable to make a Marit Lage, this deck has a natural back up plan of playing good creatures that can clock your opponent relatively quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Card Choices</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Creatures</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is the card that makes this deck play out so consistently. It’s extra copies of most of your best creatures and it increases access to the various toolbox cards the deck plays. While adding a mana to cards like Knight of the Reliquary is a cost, having access to 8 copies is a big deal and cards like Mox Diamond mitigate the drawback a fair amount.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just as <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T118463">Green Sun’s Zenith</a> increases the consistency of the creature base, these cards greatly increase the consistency of the land base. These both make it relatively straightforward to assemble the <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T218435">Dark Depths</a>/<a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T218436">Thespian’s Stage</a> combo while also providing access to a wide range of toolbox cards that can help out in a pinch. They’re also very solid creatures on rate, so they do a great job applying pressure to your opponents. <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T218444">Crop Rotation</a> doesn’t apply the same pressure that the creatures do, but it’s one of the best cards in the game at assembling a fast Marit Lage, so it serves an excellent purpose here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the key differences between this deck and a deck like Turbo Depths is the access to removal. Instead of being a straightforward combo deck, this removal suite lets the deck play out like a midrange deck. <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T167782">Swords to Plowshares</a> is just the most efficient removal spell of all time and it let’s you keep up with most creature decks. <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T221860">Skyclave Apparition</a> has a ton of utility, exiling most cards you’ll care about and provides a nice 1.5 to two-for-one. It gives the deck the additional angle of playing out like a traditional Maverick deck, which is really meaningful in a format like Legacy that has really potent threats and answers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These make up the creature toolbox of the deck and both serve a great purpose. <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T94385">Sylvan Safekeeper</a> not only protects Marit Lage very well, but works in tandem with <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T145478">Knight of the Reliquary</a>, both protecting it and acting as a way to dump lands into your graveyard. <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T176677">Knight of Autumn</a> is mostly in the deck as a way to answer problematic artifacts and enchantments, but can also gain some life in a pinch (or occasionally provide a relatively large body, when needed).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Other Spells</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In conjunction with <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T5382">Mox Diamond</a>, <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T118417">Sylvan Library</a> can generate a lot of card advantage and selection very early on. Some decks, like Miracles, are going to have a tough time dealing with it. Since this is a Marit Lage deck, the life loss is often mitigated by your opponents casting <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T167782">Swords to Plowshares</a> on the big ol’ 20/20. Sylvan is slow against certain decks, like combo and Delver, but it can still have a potent effect on the game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These help speed up the game plan pretty substantially. While this deck doesn’t play <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T179487">Life from the Loam</a> to offset the card disadvantage, it has a very focused game plan and can make great use of extra mana early.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A staple of any deck with <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T118463">Green Sun’s Zenith</a>, this gives the deck access to an early mana dork if you need it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The core combo of the deck, Marit Lage is going to end the game rather quickly against most opponents. This deck doesn’t run the full suite of <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T218435">Dark Depths</a> as not tapping for mana can be a substantial cost in some games. Additionally, being legendary means that drawing multiples can be pretty awkward, so three is a good number to land on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Lands</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This card has greatly increased in popularity with the printing of <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T192617">Elvish Reclaimer</a>. <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T180798">Flagstones</a> has become a core ramp engine, as you can sacrifice it to Reclaimer to tutor up a land, as well as search up a Plains.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These round out the tool box and, like the creatures in this deck, each serves a key purpose. <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T212363">Bojuka Bog</a> can really slow down any deck that cards about its graveyard, <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T179513">Karakas</a> makes legendary creatures relatively ineffective (and straight up answers Marit Lage) and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T34432">Sejiri Steppe</a> acts as a protection tool against removal for Marit Lage (as well as working extremely well with <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T145478">Knight of the Reliquary</a>).</p>',

  title: 'Death’s Shadow – Legacy MTG',
  content:
    '<p>There are a lot of ways to build aggressively-slanted blue decks in Legacy. There is a time and place for each option, and they come along with their own costs and benefits. Dimir Shadow is one of the most explosive versions of these decks in the format, and recently Magic Online player Diem4x came in 2nd place in the Legacy Showcase with a list popularized by another Magic Online player, Ark4n:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Core Game Plan</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In many ways, this is a traditional Legacy tempo deck. The primary plan is to deploy an early form of pressure and trade spells with the opponent, often at a mana advantage to the Shadow player, until the opponent has run out of time to answer the board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In order to maximize the power of <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=317785">Death’s Shadow</a>, this deck has a number of ways to pay life so it can precisely control its life total. While the cost of building your deck in this way is high, this allows the Shadow player to have access to some massive creatures early in the game. As a result, Dimir Shadow is one of the most aggressive decks Legacy has to offer and this makes the opponents’ window of interaction very narrow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s go over some of the specific card choices here and discuss how they fit into this deck’s game plan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Card Choices</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://crystalcommerce-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/317785/large/Image.jpg?1373667817" alt="Deaths Shadow"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=317785">Death’s Shadow</a> is the card the whole deck is built around. It can easily become the largest creature on board as early as turn 2, and it threatens to become more potent with every passing turn. As a result of its ever-scaling power, it can close out games faster than any other threat in Legacy. This really puts the onus on opponents to have the right answers on time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=6483851">Gurmag Angler</a> is a proxy for Death’s Shadows 5 and 6. It doesn’t scale quite as well as the game progresses but with high density of cheap spells in the deck it can come down on turn 2 and start clocking in for 5. The high CMC and size of Gurmag Angler allows it to conveniently dodge a lot of commonly played removal, like<a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=6475246"> Abrupt Decay</a> and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=188502">Lightning Bolt</a>, which can make it difficult to remove.</p><p><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=686087">Delver of Secrets</a> isn’t the most potent threat in this deck since Dimir Shadow doesn’t play Lightning Bolt. 3 damage a turn isn’t likely to finish the game by itself, especially when compared to Death’s Shadow and Gurmag Angler. However, Delver forces opponents to play defensively as early as the first turn of the game. It is a lot more fragile than the other threats, but requires the least amount of work. This makes it a premier threat in many combo matchups because it represents a consistent clock.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4 </strong><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=21414"><strong>Force of Will</strong></a><strong>, 4 </strong><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=23252"><strong>Daze</strong></a><strong>, 1 </strong><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=6509978"><strong>Force of Negation</strong></a><strong>, 1 </strong><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=3319923"><strong>Stubborn Denial</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is the suite of cheap counter magic that makes aggressively-slanted blue decks so effective in Legacy. All of the spells in this deck are extremely cheap and being able to play a cantrip and a removal spell in the same turn and back it up with a Force effect or a Daze allows Dimir Shadow to pull ahead very early on. Daze in particular is very effective in this deck for two reasons:</p><p>Dimir Shadow not giving opponents enough time to perfectly set up their answers, thus forcing opponents to play into Daze more often.</p><p>Returning a <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=6470241">Watery Grave</a> can allow <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=317785">Death’s Shadows</a> to become larger when you lack other ways of paying life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In other Delver decks, <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=3319923">Stubborn Denial </a>would normally be replaced with cards like <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=201649">Spell Pierce</a> and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=27492">Spell Snare</a>, but because this deck has 6 1-mana threats that enable ferocious, Denial is extremely potent. You won’t always have a creature in play, which makes this card a bit less consistent than other options, but when it is functioning at full capacity Stubborn Denial will feel like the best card in your deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2</strong><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=6529921"><strong> Brazen Borrower</strong></a><strong>, 2</strong><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=23162"><strong> Snuff Out</strong></a><strong>, 2 </strong><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=6337464"><strong>Fatal Push</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=6529921">Brazen Borrower</a> is a very versatile answer to just about any permanent that shows up. This card has become a very popular option in these aggressive blue decks since Throne of Eldraine came out. When your deck’s game plan is this aggressive, your opponents won’t have enough time to re-deploy the permanent in a meaningful way. Furthermore, it provides insurance against <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=6485861">Marit Lage</a> tokens, which makes those match ups a lot easier. After both decks have traded cards back and forth the fact that Borrower is a meaningful threat in the mid-to-late game is a big deal, as well.</p><p><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=23162">Snuff Out</a> used to be a premier removal spell in Legacy ~10 years ago. It has fallen off a lot over the years as black’s removal options have gotten better and the cost of paying 4 life has become more meaningful. In Dimir Shadow, the cost is more of a benefit and as a result, this deck can afford to play one of the most efficient removal spells offered in Legacy. This provides the deck with even more spells that can be cast for 0 mana and really drives home the aggressive angle of the deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no doubt that <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=6337464">Fatal Push</a> is one of black’s best removal spells, but in Legacy it can be somewhat common for it to not have any meaningful targets. That’s why this deck only plays 2, and it isn’t uncommon to trim those numbers down to 1 or even 0. However, it is still very effective and usually warrants being included to some extent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4 </strong><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=32581"><strong>Thoughtseize</strong></a><strong>, 4 </strong><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=29928"><strong>Street Wraith</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p><p>These are the spells that allow this deck to pay life early in the game. While <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=6514679">Veil of Summer</a> has made <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=32581">Thoughtseize</a> a bit less reliable, it is still a potent disruptive card. The fact that the life loss is a benefit to this deck is a nice feature, and it really allows Dimir Shadow to progress its game plan while disrupting the opponents’.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=29928">Street Wraith</a> is a major part of why the threats in this deck work so well. It’s a free card in the graveyard for <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=6483851">Gurmag Angler</a>, and it often means that this deck starts the game at 18 life, which makes Death Shadow a lot easier to cast.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3 </strong><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=6470241"><strong>Watery Grave</strong></a><strong>, 2 </strong><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=16761"><strong>Underground Sea</strong></a><strong>, 9 Fetchlands:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This mana base gives you a lot of power in how much damage you take from your lands. In the blind, you will often fetch + shock even if you don’t have a <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=317785">Death’s Shadow</a> in order to make future Shadows better. If you have <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=6483851">Gurmag Angler</a> as your threat and you think your life total might be under too much pressure, you can always search up an <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=16761">Underground Sea</a> to buy as much time as possible for Gurmag to close the game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Be mindful about what lands you return when you have <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=23252">Daze</a> in hand. Sometimes you want the extra damage, but other times it’s better to have a higher life total.</p>',

  title: 'Deck Highlight: Modern Polymorph',
  content:
    '<p>Modern is home to no shortage of sweet combos. However, this one impresses me in its simplicity. You use <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T32696">Polymorph</a> and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T215571">Transmogrify</a> (for our purposes, these are the same cards) on one of your own creatures. Since the only creature in your deck is <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T179448">Emrakul, the Aeons Torn</a>, you’ll hit it every time, leading to an easy win the following turn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Game Plan</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How do you get a body for <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T32696">Polymorph</a> if you’re not playing any creatures? Therein lies the beauty. This deck uses <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T199542">Dwarven Mine</a> alongside a mana base of all Mountains and nonbasics with the Mountain land type. This means that when you play your fourth land – conveniently, that’s exactly the turn you want to combo off – you can make it Dwarven Mine and generate a token to target with Polymorph. Specifically, all of your fetchlands can search for Dwarven Mine, <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T175202">Steam Vents</a> or <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T212695">Raugrin Triome</a>, making them both mana fixing and combo piece.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Token generation is built into the mana base. <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T179448">Emrakul</a> need only wait around in your library. This means that <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T32696">Polymorph</a> and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T215571">Transmogrify</a> represent one-card-combos that result in game wins. That’s extremely appealing!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So what’s the catch? Well, an opponent could <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T161480">Lightning Bolt</a> your Dwarf in response to <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T32696">Polymorph</a> in order to fizzle your combo. You can combat this with <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T187194">Teferi, Time Raveler</a>, whose passive ability prevents the opponent from interacting. Alternatively, you can use <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T171440">Cloudform</a> to generate a hexproof target. Both of these curve conveniently into a turn four Polymorph, making the whole strategy a well-oiled machine.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As is the case with many strong combo decks, the rest is rounded out by generally strong cards that help you slow down the opponent or assemble your own combo. A curve of turn two <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T233807">Remand</a>, turn three <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T187194">Teferi</a> and turn four <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T32696">Polymorph</a> is exactly what you want – and it’s not far-fetched at all. The sideboard is packed with potent hate cards like <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T192536">Leyline of Sanctity</a> (let’s stop that <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T179448">Emrakul</a> from dying to <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T179467">Liliana of the Veil</a>) and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T188994">Rest in Peace</a>.</p>',

    '<p>I’ve had a blast <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230428">squashing</a> my opponents with Izzet Giants in <i>Kaldheim</i> so far. An insane snow deck notwithstanding, I think Izzet Giants is one of the best decks in the format. A powerful version can be built with just commons and uncommons, which is almost always the sign of a premium draft archetype.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Game Plan</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the strengths of Izzet Giants is that it doesn’t have a one-size-fits-all label attached to its strategy. Different versions of the deck can play a more controlling or a more tempo-aggro role. Even different opening hands and draws can encourage different game plans within the same 40-card deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most commonly, you’re looking to win through sheer card quality and card advantage. <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230455">Aegar, the Freezing Flame</a> is one of the most crucial cards in the deck, and its ability to turn all of your <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230444">Demon Bolts</a> and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230428">Squashes</a> into two-for-ones is extraordinarily powerful. Combine those removal spells with a <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230140">Behold the Multiverse</a> or a <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230141">Glimpse the Cosmos</a> and you’re usually well ahead of your opponent by that point in the game. A couple of <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230493">Berg Striders</a> later and the game is usually over in short order.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Rares</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Izzet Giants is not reliant on rares to be successful, but there are some premium rares that really give the deck a boost in power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/230179_200w.jpg" alt="Quakebringer"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230179">Quakebringer</a> puts immediate pressure on your opponents in a big way (pun not intended). This is best in the tempo-aggro version of Giants, but you’ll pick it highly and put it in any red deck. Once you know you’re Giants, I’d actually take <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230455">Aegar</a> over this card, though.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/230454_200w.jpg" alt="Battle of Frost and Fire"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are enough other good Giants, changelings and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230891">Ravenous Lindwurms</a> running around that <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230454">Battle of Frost and Fire</a> has underperformed from my initial evaluation of it. It’s always making the cut in your Izzet deck, but it’s not a <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T220131">Wrath of God</a> with upside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/230160_200w.jpg" alt="Calamity Bearer"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Similar to <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230179">Quakebringer</a>, <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230160">Calamity Bearer</a> performs best in a tempo-aggro version of Giants, but you’re happily running this in any Giants deck. It’s especially potent when it’s doubling the damage from a <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230946">Mistwalker</a> in the air. Your neighbor passing this to you should be a signal to move into Giants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/230494_200w.jpg" alt="Cyclone Summoner"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have not had the pleasure of casting a <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230494">Cyclone Summoner</a> yet in this format, but I’ve seen it lead to some of the most amazing comebacks for my opponents and friends. This is not necessarily a windmill slam first pick, but you should let this pull you into Giants if it is passed to you.</p><p>After looking at all of these rares, I think <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230455">Aegar, the Freezing Flame</a></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/230455_200w.jpg" alt="Aegar, the Freezing Flame"></figure><p><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230455">Shop Now</a></p><p>is more important than all of them to a successful Izzet Giants deck, especially if you have multiple <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230444">Demon Bolts</a> and/or <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230428">Squashes</a>. This is more a testament to how busted Aegar is in the Giants deck in tandem with red removal than it is a slight on any of these rares.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',

  title: 'A Time Walk Down Memory Lane with Time Spiral Remastered',
  content:
    '<p>I’ve been looking at the Time Spiral Remastered previews and it brings up a fair amount of memories. To be honest, there isn’t a huge segment of my life that doesn’t have memories associated to Magic. I think they say the thing that triggers memories the most for people is smell. I definitely have a lot of associations from music to memories as well, and after looking over this spoiler, I definitely have some from Magic cards, too. Here are a few for you to read over.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Amrou Scout/Sudden Shock</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This takes me back to Grand Prix Vegas (one of the really big ones, I forget which year). I remember walking in to the tournament hall and just being absolutely struck with how many people were there. I remember saying to someone something to the effect of “Holy ‘crud,’ I will never forget this.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why do <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T233392">Amrou Scout</a> and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T234009">Sudden Shock</a> bring back memories of that event? In between one of my own rounds, I remember going and watching a brief bit of one of Matt Sperling’s matches. In addition to Rebels being a viable deck, one of the other cycles in that set was the split second cards. I remember Matt had played an Amrou Scout. On his third turn, he did whatever, and attacked. His opponent played their third land, at least one of which was a Mountain and passed back. Matt, not to be “gotten” by a Sudden Shock, played his fourth land, tapped them, used the Scout, got another Scout and passed. His opponent, looking defeated, Sudden Shocked one of the two Scouts at end of turn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That’s what I think of every time I see an <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T233392">Amrou Scout</a> or <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T234009">Sudden Shock</a> – the behemoth Grand Prix Vegas and that play by Matt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Bloodbraid Elf</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This card will probably always, unsurprisingly, remind me of Reid Duke. Turns out, when you’re friends and teammates with Reid long enough, you end up playing some Jund in your life. <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T234092">Bloodbraid Elf</a> is the card that probably, when I see it, most instantly reminds me of someone else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Funny story – one time, quite a long time ago, Reid and I were at a tournament, god knows where, finalizing our Modern Jund deck list for the next day. Reid and I were “debating” our last sideboard slot. Naturally, I should’ve just deferred. I honestly don’t remember which card I was advocating for, but I remember Reid wanted the 15th card in our sideboard to be <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T124404">Bituminous Blast</a>. We were sort of at an impasse in the conversation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reid suggested the way we settle this was as follows: his brother, Ian, was coming in an hour or so, and we’d let him decide the final card, but we both had to agree to play it. I honestly don’t remember if I agreed to this tiebreaker or if I just agreed to play Bituminous Blast anyways. An hour later though, Ian showed up. Unprompted, he walked into the room, put his things down, looked at the deck on the table and said, “Oh wow! Bituminous Blast! I <i>love</i> that card,” causing both Reid and I to erupt into laughter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Thoughtseize</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This card just elicits a visceral negative reaction from me. I know many people love it, but not me, I <strong>hate</strong> it. There’s almost nothing I like less than getting this card cast against me. Of course, it’s largely because I tend to play decks where <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T233864">Thoughtseize</a> is the most damaging, such as blue control decks and combo decks. I see a Thoughtseize and I cringe.</p><p>I know a lot of people love the card and to each their own. A lot of people don’t like control or combo decks and having tools like <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T233864">Thoughtseize</a> to keep them in check is a reasonable thing to enjoy.</p>',

  title: 'Deck Highlight: Greg Kowalski’s Standard Jeskai Cycling',
  content:
    '<p>Greg Kowalski played his take on Jeskai Cycling this past weekend in the Rivals League and I gave it a try on the Arena ladder.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/212538_200w.jpg" alt="Zenith Flare"></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/199403_200w.jpg" alt="Improbable Alliance"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The classic Cycling deck is usually Boros with four <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T212538">Zenith Flare</a> or with a light splash for <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T199403">Improbable Alliance</a> and some blue counters in the sideboard. However, Greg went a lot deeper with cards like <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T215349">Teferi, Master of Time</a> and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T212132">Rielle, the Everwise</a>, which really stretch the mana base.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Important Pieces</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T215349">Teferi</a> and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T212132">Rielle</a> are definitely interesting additions, but I felt like I would have preferred the consistency of having a two-color mana base and more cyclers. <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T212538">Zenith Flare</a> is also very often just your best card in the deck and something you want to draw every game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/212112_200w.jpg" alt="Flourishing Fox"></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/212012_200w.jpg" alt="Drannith Stinger"></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/212122_200w.jpg" alt="Valiant Rescuer"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This deck can be very fast with a turn one <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T212112">Flourishing Fox</a> and turn two <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T212012">Drannith Stinger</a>, but it can also go wide with <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T199403">Improbable Alliance</a> and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T212122">Valiant Rescuer</a>. The only downside is that you only have one good one-drop, which is a pretty big deal in a format where most players have <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T199035">Bonecrusher Giant</a> and a lot of other removal. You need to be able to add threats to the board quickly, ideally every turn starting from turn one, so it feels very bad when you have to pass turn one after playing a Triome or just cycle a card.</p>',

  title: 'Deck Highlight: Modern Esper Urza',
  content:
    '<p>There’s no denying that <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T190836">Urza, Lord High Artificer</a> is one of the strongest cards legal in Modern. Nevertheless, we haven’t seen a whole lot of him since the bannings of <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T218602">Mox Opal</a> and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T191281">Arcum’s Astrolabe</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/162125_200w.jpg" alt="Mox Amber"></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/198857_200w.jpg" alt="Emry, Lurker of the Loch"></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/212282_200w.jpg" alt="Lurrus of the Dream-Den"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This Esper-colored take on <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T190836">Urza</a> is structured in a way to utilize <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T162125">Mox Amber</a> for the explosive power that <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T218602">Mox Opal</a> used to offer. As such, one of the key cards is <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T198857">Emry, Lurker of the Loch</a>, which can be powered out for one mana quite easily and then enables big turns with Mox Amber. An uncontested Emry will typically result in a win after you can play two or three artifacts from the graveyard for free. The great thing, however, is that even if Emry gets killed, your graveyard will still be stocked for future use with <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T212282">Lurrus of the Dream-Den</a>, the <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T219010">Thopter Foundry</a>/<a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T219009">Sword of the Meek</a> combo or another copy of Emry.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/219010_200w.jpg" alt="Thopter Foundry"></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/219009_200w.jpg" alt="Sword of the Meek"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T219010">Thopter Foundry</a> plus <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T219009">Sword of the Meek</a> combo is the most direct route to victory. With both cards in play, you sacrifice Sword of the Meek to gain a life and make a 1/1 Thopter, which returns Sword of the Meek to the battlefield and allows you to repeat the process. In this way, you can generate a number of tokens and an amount of life equal to the amount of mana you invest (you can do this across a number of turns, mind you). This is already extremely good against any opponent who’s looking to pressure your life total or attack with creatures. However, if you have the <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T190836">Lord High Artificer</a>, your Sword of the Meek also generates one mana each time around, meaning that you can repeat the process infinitely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/218860_200w.jpg" alt="Stoneforge Mystic"></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/218861_200w.jpg" alt="Batterskull"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T219009">Sword of the Meek</a> is a particularly nefarious combo piece because even if it gets milled or destroyed, it still works! You simply sacrifice any other artifact to make a Thopter, which returns Sword from your graveyard and starts the combo up. Since it’s an Equipment, you can search for your one copy via <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T218860">Stoneforge Mystic</a> with minimal risk of drawing a card that might be weak in your opening hand.</p><p>Therein lies the beauty of Esper Urza. <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T218860">Stoneforge Mystic</a> is simply an awesome card, which can score you easy wins via turn three <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T218861">Batterskull</a> if it goes unanswered. This deck scores high marks on both synergy and individual card quality, meaning you’ll have an impressive amount of consistency and control over the direction of the game.</p>',

  title: 'MDFCommander – Updating the Double-Sided Commander/EDH Deck!',
  content:
    '<p>In October, I did a little bit of a thought experiment – was it possible to build a Commander deck with only double-faced cards? It turned out the answer was almost yes, with the only missing ingredient being the Commander. <a href="https://strategy.channelfireball.com/all-strategy/mtg/can-you-build-a-commander-deck-with-only-double-faced-cards/">Here’s a link to the original article</a> if you’d like to take a look, but for expediency’s sake, I’ll show you the deck list:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As you can see, the overall message was “You can, but… why?” Well, questions like that have never stopped me before, and with Kaldheim dropping even more double-faced cards on us, I figured it was time for an update. I expect them to keep showing up, so this may even become a quarterly feature.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the important double-faced cards <i>Kaldheim</i> introduced, starting with something very exciting: an eligible commander.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/230163_200w.jpg" alt="Esika, God of the Tree // The Prismatic Bridge"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230163">Esika, God of the Tree</a> is the perfect commander for this deck, and had I known she was on her way, I would have postponed the initial article. If you’re operating on a surfeit of green mana and need to branch out, the God of the Tree is just what the deck doctor ordered.</p><p>That said, with just seven legendary creatures in the original deck list, I have a feeling she’ll be working on her own. That’s okay, because as long as you have access to WUBRG, casting <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230163">The Prismatic Bridge</a> seems like the right play. Keep in mind that it’ll only put things into play front side up! So, <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T190720">Morophon, the Boundless</a> is out and Esika’s in. We’re 100 percent of the way there on theme, but we could still make some upgrades.</p><p>You might also have noticed that the original deck list sports just seven cards with the “land” typing on the front face. Kaldheim was good news though– it brought the four remaining Pathways!</p><h2><br>Adding the Pathways</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What does this mean for our deck? Well, initially I considered cutting some of the worse <i>Zendikar Rising</i> modal double-faced cards (hereafter MDFCs because I’m not typing all that again), but then I realized that trying to play this deck with just 37 lands is beyond foolish. Instead, I’d like to cut some of the older, more terrible double-faced cards and bring our land count up. I’m cutting these:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/115917_200w.jpg" alt="Westvale Abbey"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wait, the first thing I do after talking about land count is cut a land? Yes, really. Let’s be honest – this card isn’t good here. This is not a token deck. I can’t afford to sacrifice five creatures. I can’t afford to pay all this mana to rent <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T115917">Westvale Abbey</a>, and since I’m not Prince Charles, I can’t monetize the building by giving tours. Plus, it makes colorless mana? I would say “let’s make like Monopoly and mortgage this property,” but if I turn this card over, there’s no monetary value, just a very scary Demon, and I don’t need that in my life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/116497_200w.jpg" alt="Skin Invasion"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You don’t need me to explain this card’s awfulness to you, so instead I’ll just say that I never want to say “I’ll cast <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T116497">Skin Invasion</a>,” because that’s gross.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/153226_200w.jpg" alt="Storm the Vault"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was pretty clear about this in the original article, but this card is not strong for this deck. The deck isn’t going wide in any reasonable way, so the odds of ever getting there are low, and even if you do, there’s not a commensurate payoff.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/57802_200w.jpg" alt="Elbrus, the Binding Blade"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This deck is not full of evasive creatures, and for seven mana, I’d really like to cast a card that does something for the mana cost. Elbrus is not mana well spent.</p><p>So I’ve made one upgrade already – more Pathways mean more access to different types of mana, even if I’m not addressing the color balance issue. Thanks to all the Werewolves, the mana symbols on our cards are 52 percent green and red, yet we have no way to adjust for that. That’s not a problem we’ll be able to solve, so let’s ignore it and instead look at some other double-faced cards that will fit well in this list.</p>',

  content:
    '<p>Four weeks ago, <i>Kaldheim</i> was added to Standard and today, I want to show how the format has evolved since then and how it’ll evolve even further. In particular, looking at the upcoming MPL and Rivals League Weekend, I’m sure the format will shake up even more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In order to see how the metagame has evolved, I’ll refer to William “Huey” Jensen’s Standard Power Rankings, since every Monday he makes sure to adapt them based on how the weekend’s tournament go and I’ll take a look at each week’s Top 5.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Week One</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gruul and Rogues used to be the best decks in <i>Zendikar Rising</i> Standard and it’s pretty obvious to rank them in the first and second place right away to play it safe.</p><p>Izzet Flash was the hot new deck powered by Luis Scott-Vargas that saw plenty of play and raised eyebrows on the power level of <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230161">Goldspan Dragon</a>, exploiting its mana-producing ability to defend it with cheap spells such as <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T222130">Negate</a> and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230170">Saw it Coming</a>.</p><p>I loved how Huey predicted that Sultai Yorion would have been a thing as early as the first week.

His original list didn’t have <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T212597">Emergent Ultimatum</a> – that’s a piece of technology that was brought up later by Logan Nettles and now it’s the stock version of the deck.</p><p>In fifth place, Huey ranked Mono-Green Food, which was another top contender for best deck during <i>Zendikar Rising</i> Standard. However, it didn’t quite stand the test of time, and the deck is close to nonexistent in today’s metagame.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Week Two</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T212597">Emergent Ultimatum</a> tech arrived in the second week of Kaldheim Standard and the deck was incredibly strong and honestly, it felt unbeatable. It would crush midrange and other control decks and it could adjust to have a 50-50 matchup against Rogues. The aggro decks tended to still heavily rely on <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T229211">Showdown of the Skalds</a> and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T199361">The Great Henge</a> which gave the Sultai Ultimatum decks plenty of time to control the board and ramp to Emergent Ultimatum.</p><p>The new deck that rose was Rakdos Sacrifice, mostly thanks to its good matchup against Rogues and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T198999">Edgewall Innkeeper</a> decks. I’ve never been a fan of Rakdos Sacrifice in Standard, and tend to joke about how I never lose to <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T206635">Temple of Malice</a> decks, but that’s solely because I’m always playing some <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T212715">Yorion, Sky Nomad</a> midrange soup, which tends to have a great matchup against <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T206855">Kroxa, Titan of Death’s Hunger</a> decks. How well Rakdos Sacrifice will do in a metagame is inversely proportionate to how many Yorion, Sky Nomads are around.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Week Three</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The third week of Kaldheim Standard saw an incredible amount of shake up since the metagame adapted to its past number one deck, Sultai Ultimatum, by lowering a lot the mana curve of the aggro decks, bringing back Mono-White and Mono-Red Aggro!</p><p>The secret weapon of these aggro decks was <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230188">Faceless Haven</a>, which would play perfectly around Sultai’s sweepers to assure important damage gets in.</p><p>Another card that rose in popularity in week three was <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T221923">Roiling Vortex</a>, with four copies in Mono-Red and Boros sideboards to fight the <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T212597">Emergent Ultimatum</a> deck, pushing it to the third spot.</p><p>The presence of aforementioned aggro decks also made it so that Rogues was all of a sudden obsolete in the metagame, although Huey was kind enough to still put it in fourth place. I would say Rogues is on its way to retirement after seeing this upraise of aggro decks.</p><p>Gruul and Naya Adventures were also pushed down to fifth place since they have a quite terrible matchup against Sultai Ultimatum, although they could still put up a good fight against the newcomer aggro decks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Week Four</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Week four was an aggressive one! Mono-Red was all over the places; four Mono-Reds placed in the Top 12 of SCG Arena PTQ with Christoffer Larsen winning it all with it.</p><p>The rest of the Top 5 featured various aggro decks, from the well known Gruul and Naya Adventure to the quote-unquote “new” deck in the format: Jeskai Cycling!</p><p>Jeskai Cycling is an old friend of Standard. Last year, it was battling against Jeskai Lukka Fires, and has basically gotten zero new cards since <i>Ikoria</i>. However, it has a good place in the metagame, with a great matchup against Mono-Red and Sultai Ultimatum, and that’s why we’ve seen it popping up in Top 8s and even up to the number one spot on the Mythic ladder in the hands of Javier Dominguez.</p><p>Huey didn’t include Mono-White Aggro in his Top 5 decks, although it’s still worth mentioning that the deck is still a top contender and I’m sure it’ll be greatly represented in this weekend’s MPL and Rivals League.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Week Five</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Week five started with Rivals Member’s Chris Botelho reaching the number one spot on the Mythic Ladder with Temur Adventures featuring four copies of Alrund’s Epiphany, his list a mix between Temur Ramp and Izzet Flash. It looks strong, effective and I wouldn’t be surprised if this ends up being a player in the upcoming metagame, although I still expect Mono-Red to be the most played deck in this weekend’s MPL and Rivals League play.</p>',

  title: 'Pauper Power Rankings: February Update',
  content:
    '<p>It’s time for our monthly check in on the Pauper metagame. The banning of <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T226844">Fall from Favo</a>r paired with the release of <i>Kaldheim </i>has had a massive impact. For the second time in many months, there’s a new number one deck.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What’s caused these changes? The banning of <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T226844">Fall from Favor</a> allowed some of the other powerful cards from <i>Commander Legends</i> – specifically <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T227023">Annoyed Altisaur</a> and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T227232">Boarding Party</a> – to shine. Then <i>Kaldheim </i>brought along Pauper’s first dual lands with basic land types which helped to unlock all sorts of deck building possibilities. Let’s get to the Top 10, which has four archetypes that weren’t featured last time around.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>10: Bogles</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bogles has been a staple of Pauper for years. <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T118505">Ancestral Mask</a> and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T66560">Ethereal Armor</a> are powerful force multipliers and every year there are a few more cheap Auras that help to bolster the archetype. Bogles tends to shine when decks are not running a lot of pieces of <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T180795">Chainer’s Edict</a>-style removal, but thanks to <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T129725">Cartouche of Solidarity</a> and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T171229">Khalni Garden</a>, it has some counterplay. So why is it having a moment now?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pauper usually has space for one deck that “goes tall” – that is a deck that wants to build one large threat and ride it to victory. Last time around, this spot went to Heroic. Heroic, however, lacks a way to end the game if it can’t attack. Bogles has access to <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T212717">Ram Through</a> which can punch a hole in your opponent. It also added <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230107">Arctic Treeline</a> which makes <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T161900">Utopia Sprawl</a> slightly better.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>9: Cycling Songs</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cycling Songs is a powerful combo deck that wants to use <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T180939">Songs of the Damned</a> and a ton of cards that cycle for one mana to generate a ton of mana, get them back with <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T10898">Reaping the Graves</a>, and then try to kill with <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T212012">Drannith Stinger</a>. The deck is wild and pretty resilient. If anything, it’s gotten a boost from a lack of decks running incidental graveyard hate as a way to try and attack <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T128877">Ghostly Flicker</a> lock decks. Given the current trends in Pauper, I can see this deck sticking around the Top 10 for a bit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>8: Dimir Delver</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dimir Delver took a hit this month. It’s not that the deck got appreciably worse, but rather everything else got that much better. Perhaps that biggest knock on Dimir Delver is that it really does not want an early copy of <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T230110">Ice Tunnel</a>, where it’s less aggressive cousin, Dimir Faeries, is better suited to have a tapped land on turn one.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>7: Burn</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Burn is incredibly good at getting folks dead. While it lacks some of the recurring sources of damage that makes the deck a staple in other formats – namely <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T161444">Eidolon of the Great Revel</a> and <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T118599">Sulfuric Vortex</a> – it gets the job done with Thermo-Alchemist and Curse of the Pierced Heart. All that being said, Burn is perhaps the easiest deck to hate out of Pauper thanks to abundant amounts of cheap and effective life gain (<a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T191064">Weather the Storm</a> anyone?).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>6: Elves</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We’re starting to see a theme: decks that can operate on minimal lands have had a good few weeks. This is due in part to the success of Gruul and Jund Ramp strategies, which can pack up to eight main deck pieces of land destruction. Elves is a deck that can attack from multiple angles and, despite being composed of multiple tiny creatures, is fairly resilient to sweepers. This deck rewards knowing the weak points of the other top decks and packing a kill mechanism that can exploit said flaws.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>5: Dimir Faeries</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dimir Faeries got two new tools in Behold the Multiverse and Ice Tunnel, and yet it took a pretty significant hit in the standings. What gives?</p><p>In my experience, the ramp decks perform fairly well against this strategy and, seeing as how they’re some of the most played decks currently, it follows that Dimir Faeries might be struggling a bit. There have already started to be some adjustments – such as copies of <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T212231">Bonder’s Ornament</a> main – to account for this shift.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>4: Gruul/Jund Ramp</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Full disclosure: I do not think this strategy is as good as it’s ranking. While it’s absolutely a strong archetype, it’s getting a boost from being the new kid on the block. Ramp is a novel deck that has some unbeatable draws. That being said we’re seeing the metagame adjust to the presence of a powerful Ponza strategy. The next step will be to see if these decks can adapt to their role as top player as opposed to underdog.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>3: Flicker Tron</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My current working theory is that Tron has survived this long because some of the powers that be <i>knew</i> that Pauper was going to be getting a power boost. The philosophy that raised the power level across all Constructed formats has finally trickled down to Pauper. The result is Tron – the best deck in the format for almost 18 months – has fallen from perennial gold medalist to bronze. Tron is not going anywhere but as other decks continue to get new tools that Tron cannot easily add, I expect the deck’s standing to fluctuate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>2: Izzet Faeries</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Time and time again, Dimir and Izzet Faeries continue to flip flop in the standings. Sometimes having cheap red removal is better, especially when you can back that up with Fiery Cannonade. Volatile Fjord has been a boon to the deck as well, giving it outs to have red sources that help discount on Spire Golem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>1: Boros Bullies</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Boros Bully is the de facto beatdown in the new Pauper. It won both the February 19 and 20 Challenges and has taken down four of the eight events since <i>Kaldheim </i>hit the scene. Battle Screech and Squadron Hawk square up nicely against targeted removal. The air force also does a decent job of getting around <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T227023">Annoyed Altisaur</a> with the help of Rally the Peasants <i>and </i>the deck packs <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T196483">Prismatic Strands</a> to get around <a href="https://store.channelfireball.com/catalog/lookup?catalog_id=T227177">Fiery Cannonade</a>. All in all, a winning recipe.</p>',
